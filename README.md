### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working in Product and Data, in the Healthcare industry.    
I am fascinated working in regulated areas, like healthcare and fintech.

I am a Physicist by education and I like good explanations and data. If you are looking for a book about good explanations, have a look at [The Beginning of Infinity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10483171-the-beginning-of-infinity) by David Deutsch.
